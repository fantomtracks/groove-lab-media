## Groove and simplicity ?

In an age of Instagram reels and YouTube shorts where musicians are expected to 
play faster, flashier, and louder, Ian Trusheim has chosen a different path. 
Instead of chasing instant impressions, he slows the pace: one simple original 
bass line every single day for an entire year. Far from a mere 
stunt, this daily ritual posted on 
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/iantrusheim/" target="_blank">his instagram</a> 
has become a genuine creative laboratory.

## One p-bass, multitude of grooves.

The Ian methodology seems simple. He focuses his eforts to plays with 
consistency and an impecable timming. He choose not to be a busy bass player. 
It's result with authenticity and make the music speaks by itself. His day to 
day gives un instand fresh air to any instagram feed.

## A Conversation with Scott Devine
In conversation with Scott Devine on 
<a href="https://youtu.be/-clvLZZtVg0?si=JVUAcZDsBSeCYJSy" target="_blank">Scott’s Bass Lessons YouTube channel</a>,
Ian deep dive about the method he devised to balance both consistency and authenticity in 
his writing. There was no question of producing a repetitive catalogue: each 
day had to bring its own colour, its own mood, its own unique groove.

## The Educator’s Perspective
As a seasoned educator, teaching at Stages Music Arts, Ian shares his vision 
of the bass as both a foundational and profoundly expressive instrument. 
To compose a line a day is, in his view, to tell a story — sometimes fleeting, 
sometimes enduring.

## A Chronicle of Passion and Craft
The result? An intimate chronicle of creativity laid bare, a daily collection 
shaped by passion, technique, and above all the conviction that an authentic 
musician can push boundaries without compromise.
