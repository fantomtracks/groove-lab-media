In early 2024, bassist Ian Trusheim set himself a simple yet demanding 
challenge: to compose and post a brand-new bass line every single day 
on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iantrusheim/" target="_blank">Instagram.</a>
What began as a daily exercise quickly evolved into a remarkable 
creative journey—one built on discipline, restraint, and a deep 
understanding of groove.

## Groove over excess

Today’s social media landscape is shaped by Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, 
where musicians are often encouraged to play faster, flashier, and louder. 
Ian Trusheim, however, has chosen a very different path. Rather than chasing 
instant impact, he focuses on space, silence, impeccable timing, and tone. 
His bass lines breathe. They leave room for the music to unfold and for 
other instruments to shine.

This deliberate slowness runs counter to the logic of social media algorithms, 
yet it is precisely what makes his work so compelling. By resisting excess, 
Trusheim reminds us that groove is not about virtuosity alone, but about feel, 
intention, and musical awareness.

## The Art of Simplicity

Simplicity, however, should never be mistaken for ease. Writing a bass line 
that is both minimal and memorable is a rare skill. At Groove Lab Media, we 
believe that such lines form the backbone of some of the most enduring tracks 
in popular music. Think of John Deacon’s work on “Another One Bites the Dust” 
Paul McCartney’s bass line on “Come Together” or Paul Simonon’s iconic line 
on “Feel Good Inc.” These lines endure not because they are complex, 
but because they are perfectly placed.

## A Year-Long Creative Experiment

This philosophy naturally led to his most ambitious project: a challenge 
to create a simple, original two-bar bass line every day for an entire year. 
Posted daily on Instagram, these short performances became a kind of open 
creative laboratory.

Some entries are straightforward grooves, while others evolve into fully 
formed miniature compositions, often enhanced by collaborations with drummers 
such as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sluprok" target="_blank">Sluprok</a>. 
Together, they transform a simple idea into a complete musical moment.

Here are some examples:

## Discipline, Growth, and Musical Vision

In a conversation with Scott Devine on the 
<a href="https://youtu.be/-clvLZZtVg0?si=JVUAcZDsBSeCYJSy" target="_blank">Scott’s Bass Lessons YouTube channel</a>, 
Ian Trusheim reflects on the creative breakthroughs that emerged from 
committing to such a strict routine. He speaks openly about discipline, 
creative blocks, and how consistency can lead not only to technical 
improvement, but to greater musical confidence and clarity.

During the interview, he also discusses his iconic 1966 Fender Precision Bass, 
strung with flatwound strings—a key element of the warm, focused tone that has 
become his sonic signature.

On his own YouTube channel, Trusheim explores these ideas further in a 
<a href="https://youtu.be/8dARo0u-wlg?si=EY5M02LXgLWHvriV" target="_blank">video 
dedicated to what he humorously calls “bass monogamy.”</a> Beneath the playful 
title lies a thoughtful reflection on commitment—not just to an instrument, 
but to a sound, a vision, and a long-term artistic path.

## Beyond the Challenge: The Moriel Trio

Although the original challenge was conceived as a 365-day journey, 
Trusheim ultimately chose to conclude it on day 211. Rather than a setback, 
this decision allowed him to redirect his energy toward other creative projects. 
He continued exploring similar ideas through a new series titled Two Bar Tuesday, 
while freeing up time to focus on collaborative work.

One such project is The Moriel Trio, alongside 
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/jazzitdown?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=cmdnM3ZzNDZxbHc3" target="_blank">Grant Fisher</a> 
on guitar and 
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/gbone0623?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=MTVlYnhtazVkZTJlaA==" target="_blank">Mike Gambone</a> on drums. 
The trio recently released an EP that captures the same values found in 
Trusheim’s daily bass lines: groove, restraint, and musical conversation. 
The release is available on all major streaming platforms, with a digital 
version also offered on Bandcamp.

## Looking Ahead

With his sense of groove, originality, and unwavering commitment to his craft, 
Ian Trusheim stands out in a landscape often driven by immediacy and excess. 
His work is a reminder that music does not need to shout to be heard—and 
that sometimes, the most powerful ideas are the simplest ones.

At Groove Lab Media, we look forward to following his next adventures.
