## Groove and simplicity ?

In an age of Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, where musicians are expected 
to play faster, flashier, and louder, Ian Trusheim has chosen a different path. 
He crafts bass lines with space and silence, impeccable timing, 
and excellent tone. Instead of chasing instant impressions, he deliberately 
slows the pace, creating grooves that highlight the other instruments.

This approach, which goes against what social media algorithms expect, 
is anything but simplistic. Creating a bass line that is simple, effective, 
and recognizable in just a few notes is not something everyone can do. 
At Groove Lab Media, we believe that such lines are the foundation of the 
greatest songs—“Another One Bites the Dust,” “Come Together,” “Feel Good Inc.,” 
“Smoke on the Water,” and many more.

## Create a two bar bassline 365 days challenge

Ian Trusheim expanded his vision by creating one simple, original bass line 
every single day for an entire year on 
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/iantrusheim/" target="_blank">his Instagram</a> 
account. 

His daily posts have become a genuine creative laboratory, offering 
tasty bass lines and, at times, great mini pieces of music with the help of 
drummers like

## Ian Trusheim’s Journey and Vision

In a conversation with Scott Devine on 
<a href="https://youtu.be/-clvLZZtVg0?si=JVUAcZDsBSeCYJSy" target="_blank">Scott’s Bass Lessons YouTube channel</a>, 
Ian Trusheim dives deep into the creative breakthroughs, discipline, and growth 
that come from committing to such a strict regimen. He explains how pushing 
through obstacles can lead to stronger skills, more ideas, and greater musical 
confidence. Ian Trusheim also shares the story behind his iconic 1966 Fender 
Precision Bass, equipped with flatwound strings, which gives him his incredible 
tone.

In another 
<a href="https://youtu.be/8dARo0u-wlg?si=EY5M02LXgLWHvriV" target="_blank">video on his own YouTube channel</a>, 
Ian Trusheim even goes so far as to talk about “bass monogamy.” Behind this 
amusing title, he shares his thoughts on his vision of music and his career as 
a musician.


## The Morel Trio project

Unfortunately, Ian Trusheim didn’t make it to 365 days. He decided to end the 
challenge on day 211 to focus on other projects. He continued to post similar 
videos as part of a new series called “Two Bar Tuesday,” which gave him more 
free time to release an EP with 
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/jazzitdown?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=cmdnM3ZzNDZxbHc3" target="_blank">Grant Fisher </a> 
(guitar) and

(drums) under the name 
<a href="https://themoreltrio.com/" target="_blank">The Moriel Trio</a>. 
You can listen to it on all streaming platforms or purchase the digital version
