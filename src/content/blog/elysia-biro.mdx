If the name does not ring a bell yet, it probably will soon. 
Canadian singer-songwriter and keyboardist Elysia Biro released her debut 
single, “Just Wait For a Minute,” on September 12, 2025. With this first 
release, she introduces a tender and heartfelt love song.

## A Gentle, Intimate Sound

“Just Wait For a Minute” opens with soft piano textures that immediately set 
an intimate, reflective mood. As the track unfolds, a double bass enters, 
giving way to a bright, uplifting chorus. These instrumental touches 
perfectly complement Elysia Biro’s tender vocals, inviting the listener to 
savour each moment of affection and celebrate love in its simple, honest form.

## Roots and Beginnings

The music video appears to have been filmed in a serene Canadian pine forest, 
reflecting the natural surroundings of Vancouver Island, where Elysia Biro 
grew up. She started piano lessons at age four and, by 13, was already 
exploring jazz on her own and writing her own music. Over the years, she 
completed a Bachelor of Music in Jazz Studies, a Master’s degree in Music, 
and a diploma in classical piano, combining solid training with a 
clear sense of artistic curiosity.

## Online visibility 

Biro has gradually built a dedicated online following by sharing videos 
of her performances, as well as jazz transcriptions and piano explorations. 
These posts not only showcase her technical skill and musicality, 
but also give fans a glimpse into her creative process, connecting her 
work with listeners in a personal and engaging way. Here is some exemples :
